**WEEK 4 - 1D and 2D Smooth Bifurcations**

The focus today was on the structure of bifurcations, that is, the ways in which equilibria appear and disappear as parameters are changed.

Regard the following 1D dynamical systems. While x represents the state variable in the one dimensional system, c is a shape parameter, representing smooth changes of the manifold that embeds the orbits.

Smoothly changing c in the equations above leads to both smooth and abrupt transitions of the dynamics, depending on whether equilibria appear, disappear, or change in shape.

 

In all equations 1, 2 and 3, the roots of the polynomial are modulated by c, and the derivatives at the equilibria have different roots.

Changes in c reflect changes in the equilibrium states of these dynamical systems. As c varies, transitions in the equilibria happen in a well determined sequence. In the first equation, as c goes from negative to positive, we go from no fixed point (imaginary roots), to a root that attracts orbits to the left and repels those on the right of the center. Notice that this is reflected in the type of roots of the function (real or imaginary, positive or negative, larger or smaller than one). 

 

This is a compilation of different bifurcation scenarios, where continuous/dashed lines represent stable/unstable equilibria. As an exercise, look with your mind’s eye, and see if you can visualize the flows for orbits starting at some positions of x. Try also to visualize the shape of the functions that beget them. In chapter 1 of Hale and Koçak you can find the names of these particular kinds of bifurcations.

In two dimensions other types of bifurcations are available, such as the Hopf bifurcation. They appear as a function of the intersections between nullclines. As in 1D, the types of equilibria are then determined by the x and y components of the flow near the equilibria. As in 1D, bifurcations appear when the equilibria change their characteristics (attractor/repellor/saddle-node).
